    "# **What is it?**\n",
    "\n",
    "# The simplest implementation of RAG embeds a user query and do a single embedding search in a vector database, like a vector store of Wikipedia articles. However, this approach often falls short when dealing with complex queries and diverse data sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "# **What are the limitations?**\n",
    "\n",
    "# - **Query-Document Mismatch:** It assumes that the query and document embeddings will align in the vector space, which is often not the case.\n",
    "#     - Query: \"Tell me about climate change effects on marine life.\"\n",
    "#     - Issue: The model might retrieve documents related to general climate change or marine life, missing the specific intersection of both topics.\n",
    "# - **Monolithic Search Backend:** It relies on a single search method and backend, reducing flexibility and the ability to handle multiple data sources.\n",
    "#     - Query: \"Latest research in quantum computing.\"\n",
    "#     - Issue: The model might only search in a general science database, missing out on specialized quantum computing resources.\n",
    "# - **Text Search Limitations:** The model is restricted to simple text queries without the nuances of advanced search features.\n",
    "#     - Query: \"what problems did we fix last week\"\n",
    "#     - Issue: cannot be answered by a simple text search since documents that contain problem, last week are going to be present at every week.\n",
    "# - **Limited Planning Ability:** It fails to consider additional contextual information that could refine the search results.\n",
    "#     - Query: \"Tips for first-time Europe travelers.\"\n",
    "#     - Issue: The model might provide general travel advice, ignoring the specific context of first-time travelers or European destinations.\n",

Subsequently, the Company incurred losses for three consecutive years (during FY 2019-20, 2020-21 & 2021-22), thereby calling for an automatic cancellation/\\nwithdrawal of pension fund exemption. On November 4, 2022, the Hon\\'ble Supreme Court also ruled that those who were members of a statutory pension fund as on September 1,\\n2014, can exercise a joint option with their employer to contribute to their Pension fund beyond the statutory limit and be eligible to draw their pension calculated based on last 5 years\\naverage salary. The Company accepted and approved the applications filed by its employees for joint option to contribute on higher salary on the EPFO’s portal. As per the actuarial\\nvaluation, an additional provision of ₹5 crores and ₹32 crores have been made for pension on higher salary during the quarter and six months ended September 30, 2024, respectively.\\nEPFO, however, redirected a few of such Joint Applications to the Company’s Pension Trust. Considering this, along with the fact that there was no positive movement towards the\\nconclusion of the surrender process of the pension fund, the Company filed a Writ Petition with Hon\\'ble Delhi High Court for seeking directions to EPFO to immediately start administering\\nTML’s Pension Fund, not to reject the joint applications and reconsider the applications it has redirected. The trade unions have also filed another Writ Petition for expediting the transfer\\nof pension fund corpus and accepting the Joint Applications of the employees. The matter shall be listed before the High Court on November 22, 2024 for arguments.\\n5) During the quarter and six months ended September 30, 2024, Finance Act 2024 was passed and there were amendments in the manner of calculation of the long-term capital gain.\\nFurther, the Finance Act, 2024 also reduced the tax rate on long term capital gain from previously 20% to 12.5% (excluding applicable surcharge and education cess thereon).\\nConsequent to the above amendments, the Company has recognized an additional one-time Deferred-tax liability of ₹248 crores and reversed Deferred-tax asset of ₹155 crores in\\nthe quarter and six months ended on September 30, 2024.\\n6) The Board of Directors, at its meeting held on July 25, 2023, approved (subject to, inter alia, obtaining the regulatory and other approvals including from the Hon’ble National\\nCompany Law Tribunal (NCLT)) a Scheme of Arrangement (Scheme) for reduction, through cancellation of the entire “A” Ordinary Share capital and in consideration thereof, issue\\nand allotment of New Ordinary Shares in the Company, in the manner as contemplated in the Scheme.\\nThe Hon’ble NCLT vide Order dated August 2, 2024 has sanctioned the Scheme which was effective from September 1, 2024. Accordingly, the Company cancelled 50,85,02,896 ‘A’\\nOrdinary shares of ₹2.00 each (₹102 crores) and issued 35,59,52,028 New Ordinary Shares of ₹2.00 each (₹71 crores). The resultant difference of ₹31 crores is recorded in Securities\\nPremium Account. Out of above 87,73,540 New Ordinary Shares are yet to be transferred to the ultimate shareholders/ beneficial owners through TML Securities Trust, constituted\\nfor implementation of the Scheme and the same is consolidated in the Financial Results. The total expenses of ₹68 crores (including ₹50 crores for the six months ended September\\n30, 2024) incurred on the cancellation of ‘A’ Ordinary Shares have been accounted through retained earnings. The issue of New Ordinary Shares as consideration for reduction by\\nway of cancellation of ‘A’ Ordinary Shares, was considered to be ‘Deemed Dividend’ in the hands of ‘A’ Ordinary Shareholders in terms of the Income Tax Act, 1961. The TDS liability\\nof the Company on the aforesaid ‘Deemed Dividend’, amounting to ₹1,073 crores, has been funded through sale of requisite number of New Ordinary Shares, in the manner as\\ncontemplated in the Scheme.\\n7) The Board of Directors has, at its meeting held on August 1, 2024, approved (subject to the requisite and other approvals) a Composite Scheme of Arrangement involving the\\ndemerger of its Commercial Vehicle (“CV”) business undertaking into TML Commercial Vehicles Limited (newly incorporated entity) and the merger of Tata Motors Passenger\\nVehicles Limited (“TMPVL”) with the existing listed company thereby resulting in two separate listed companies for the CV and Passenger Vehicle (“PV”) businesses. The Company\\nhas filed this Scheme of Arrangement on August 13, 2024 with respective stock exchanges where the shares of the Company are traded and the requisite approvals are awaited.\\n8) The Statutory Auditors have carried an audit of the above results for the quarter and six months ended September 30, 2024 and have issued an unmodified opinion on the same.\\n Tata Motors Limited\\n Girish Wagh\\nMumbai, November 8, 2024 Executive Director\"\n",

Subsequently, the Company incurred losses for three consecutive years (during FY 2019-20, 2020-21 & 2021-22), thereby calling for an automatic cancellation/\\nwithdrawal of pension fund exemption. On November 4, 2022, the Hon\\'ble Supreme Court also ruled that those who were members of a statutory pension fund as on September 1,\\n2014, can exercise a joint option with their employer to contribute to their Pension fund beyond the statutory limit and be eligible to draw their pension calculated based on last 5 years\\naverage salary. The Company accepted and approved the applications filed by its employees for joint option to contribute on higher salary on the EPFO’s portal. As per the actuarial\\nvaluation, an additional provision of ₹5 crores and ₹32 crores have been made for pension on higher salary during the quarter and six months ended September 30, 2024, respectively.\\nEPFO, however, redirected a few of such Joint Applications to the Company’s Pension Trust. Considering this, along with the fact that there was no positive movement towards the\\nconclusion of the surrender process of the pension fund, the Company filed a Writ Petition with Hon\\'ble Delhi High Court for seeking directions to EPFO to immediately start administering\\nTML’s Pension Fund, not to reject the joint applications and reconsider the applications it has redirected. The trade unions have also filed another Writ Petition for expediting the transfer\\nof pension fund corpus and accepting the Joint Applications of the employees. The matter shall be listed before the High Court on November 22, 2024 for arguments.\\n5) During the quarter and six months ended September 30, 2024, Finance Act 2024 was passed and there were amendments in the manner of calculation of the long-term capital gain.\\nFurther, the Finance Act, 2024 also reduced the tax rate on long term capital gain from previously 20% to 12.5% (excluding applicable surcharge and education cess thereon).\\nConsequent to the above amendments, the Company has recognized an additional one-time Deferred-tax liability of ₹248 crores and reversed Deferred-tax asset of ₹155 crores in\\nthe quarter and six months ended on September 30, 2024.\\n6) The Board of Directors, at its meeting held on July 25, 2023, approved (subject to, inter alia, obtaining the regulatory and other approvals including from the Hon’ble National\\nCompany Law Tribunal (NCLT)) a Scheme of Arrangement (Scheme) for reduction, through cancellation of the entire “A” Ordinary Share capital and in consideration thereof, issue\\nand allotment of New Ordinary Shares in the Company, in the manner as contemplated in the Scheme.\\nThe Hon’ble NCLT vide Order dated August 2, 2024 has sanctioned the Scheme which was effective from September 1, 2024. Accordingly, the Company cancelled 50,85,02,896 ‘A’\\nOrdinary shares of ₹2.00 each (₹102 crores) and issued 35,59,52,028 New Ordinary Shares of ₹2.00 each (₹71 crores). The resultant difference of ₹31 crores is recorded in Securities\\nPremium Account. Out of above 87,73,540 New Ordinary Shares are yet to be transferred to the ultimate shareholders/ beneficial owners through TML Securities Trust, constituted\\nfor implementation of the Scheme and the same is consolidated in the Financial Results. The total expenses of ₹68 crores (including ₹50 crores for the six months ended September\\n30, 2024) incurred on the cancellation of ‘A’ Ordinary Shares have been accounted through retained earnings. The issue of New Ordinary Shares as consideration for reduction by\\nway of cancellation of ‘A’ Ordinary Shares, was considered to be ‘Deemed Dividend’ in the hands of ‘A’ Ordinary Shareholders in terms of the Income Tax Act, 1961. The TDS liability\\nof the Company on the aforesaid ‘Deemed Dividend’, amounting to ₹1,073 crores, has been funded through sale of requisite number of New Ordinary Shares, in the manner as\\ncontemplated in the Scheme.\\n7) The Board of Directors has, at its meeting held on August 1, 2024, approved (subject to the requisite and other approvals) a Composite Scheme of Arrangement involving the\\ndemerger of its Commercial Vehicle (“CV”) business undertaking into TML Commercial Vehicles Limited (newly incorporated entity) and the merger of Tata Motors Passenger\\nVehicles Limited (“TMPVL”) with the existing listed company thereby resulting in two separate listed companies for the CV and Passenger Vehicle (“PV”) businesses. The Company\\nhas filed this Scheme of Arrangement on August 13, 2024 with respective stock exchanges where the shares of the Company are traded and the requisite approvals are awaited.\\n8) The Statutory Auditors have carried an audit of the above results for the quarter and six months ended September 30, 2024 and have issued an unmodified opinion on the same.\\n Tata Motors Limited\\n Girish Wagh\\nMumbai, November 8, 2024 Executive Director\"\n",

Subsequently, the Company incurred losses for three consecutive years (during FY 2019-20, 2020-21 & 2021-22), thereby calling for an automatic cancellation/\\nwithdrawal of pension fund exemption. On November 4, 2022, the Hon\\'ble Supreme Court also ruled that those who were members of a statutory pension fund as on September 1,\\n2014, can exercise a joint option with their employer to contribute to their Pension fund beyond the statutory limit and be eligible to draw their pension calculated based on last 5 years\\naverage salary. The Company accepted and approved the applications filed by its employees for joint option to contribute on higher salary on the EPFO’s portal. As per the actuarial\\nvaluation, an additional provision of ₹5 crores and ₹32 crores have been made for pension on higher salary during the quarter and six months ended September 30, 2024, respectively.\\nEPFO, however, redirected a few of such Joint Applications to the Company’s Pension Trust. Considering this, along with the fact that there was no positive movement towards the\\nconclusion of the surrender process of the pension fund, the Company filed a Writ Petition with Hon\\'ble Delhi High Court for seeking directions to EPFO to immediately start administering\\nTML’s Pension Fund, not to reject the joint applications and reconsider the applications it has redirected. The trade unions have also filed another Writ Petition for expediting the transfer\\nof pension fund corpus and accepting the Joint Applications of the employees. The matter shall be listed before the High Court on November 22, 2024 for arguments.\\n5) During the quarter and six months ended September 30, 2024, Finance Act 2024 was passed and there were amendments in the manner of calculation of the long-term capital gain.\\nFurther, the Finance Act, 2024 also reduced the tax rate on long term capital gain from previously 20% to 12.5% (excluding applicable surcharge and education cess thereon).\\nConsequent to the above amendments, the Company has recognized an additional one-time Deferred-tax liability of ₹248 crores and reversed Deferred-tax asset of ₹155 crores in\\nthe quarter and six months ended on September 30, 2024.\\n6) The Board of Directors, at its meeting held on July 25, 2023, approved (subject to, inter alia, obtaining the regulatory and other approvals including from the Hon’ble National\\nCompany Law Tribunal (NCLT)) a Scheme of Arrangement (Scheme) for reduction, through cancellation of the entire “A” Ordinary Share capital and in consideration thereof, issue\\nand allotment of New Ordinary Shares in the Company, in the manner as contemplated in the Scheme.\\nThe Hon’ble NCLT vide Order dated August 2, 2024 has sanctioned the Scheme which was effective from September 1, 2024. Accordingly, the Company cancelled 50,85,02,896 ‘A’\\nOrdinary shares of ₹2.00 each (₹102 crores) and issued 35,59,52,028 New Ordinary Shares of ₹2.00 each (₹71 crores). The resultant difference of ₹31 crores is recorded in Securities\\nPremium Account. Out of above 87,73,540 New Ordinary Shares are yet to be transferred to the ultimate shareholders/ beneficial owners through TML Securities Trust, constituted\\nfor implementation of the Scheme and the same is consolidated in the Financial Results. The total expenses of ₹68 crores (including ₹50 crores for the six months ended September\\n30, 2024) incurred on the cancellation of ‘A’ Ordinary Shares have been accounted through retained earnings. The issue of New Ordinary Shares as consideration for reduction by\\nway of cancellation of ‘A’ Ordinary Shares, was considered to be ‘Deemed Dividend’ in the hands of ‘A’ Ordinary Shareholders in terms of the Income Tax Act, 1961. The TDS liability\\nof the Company on the aforesaid ‘Deemed Dividend’, amounting to ₹1,073 crores, has been funded through sale of requisite number of New Ordinary Shares, in the manner as\\ncontemplated in the Scheme.\\n7) The Board of Directors has, at its meeting held on August 1, 2024, approved (subject to the requisite and other approvals) a Composite Scheme of Arrangement involving the\\ndemerger of its Commercial Vehicle (“CV”) business undertaking into TML Commercial Vehicles Limited (newly incorporated entity) and the merger of Tata Motors Passenger\\nVehicles Limited (“TMPVL”) with the existing listed company thereby resulting in two separate listed companies for the CV and Passenger Vehicle (“PV”) businesses. The Company\\nhas filed this Scheme of Arrangement on August 13, 2024 with respective stock exchanges where the shares of the Company are traded and the requisite approvals are awaited.\\n8) The Statutory Auditors have carried an audit of the above results for the quarter and six months ended September 30, 2024 and have issued an unmodified opinion on the same.\\n Tata Motors Limited\\n Girish Wagh\\nMumbai, November 8, 2024 Executive Director\"\n",

Subsequently, the Company incurred losses for three consecutive years (during FY 2019-20, 2020-21 & 2021-22), thereby calling for an automatic cancellation/\\nwithdrawal of pension fund exemption. On November 4, 2022, the Hon\\'ble Supreme Court also ruled that those who were members of a statutory pension fund as on September 1,\\n2014, can exercise a joint option with their employer to contribute to their Pension fund beyond the statutory limit and be eligible to draw their pension calculated based on last 5 years\\naverage salary. The Company accepted and approved the applications filed by its employees for joint option to contribute on higher salary on the EPFO’s portal. As per the actuarial\\nvaluation, an additional provision of ₹5 crores and ₹32 crores have been made for pension on higher salary during the quarter and six months ended September 30, 2024, respectively.\\nEPFO, however, redirected a few of such Joint Applications to the Company’s Pension Trust. Considering this, along with the fact that there was no positive movement towards the\\nconclusion of the surrender process of the pension fund, the Company filed a Writ Petition with Hon\\'ble Delhi High Court for seeking directions to EPFO to immediately start administering\\nTML’s Pension Fund, not to reject the joint applications and reconsider the applications it has redirected. The trade unions have also filed another Writ Petition for expediting the transfer\\nof pension fund corpus and accepting the Joint Applications of the employees. The matter shall be listed before the High Court on November 22, 2024 for arguments.\\n5) During the quarter and six months ended September 30, 2024, Finance Act 2024 was passed and there were amendments in the manner of calculation of the long-term capital gain.\\nFurther, the Finance Act, 2024 also reduced the tax rate on long term capital gain from previously 20% to 12.5% (excluding applicable surcharge and education cess thereon).\\nConsequent to the above amendments, the Company has recognized an additional one-time Deferred-tax liability of ₹248 crores and reversed Deferred-tax asset of ₹155 crores in\\nthe quarter and six months ended on September 30, 2024.\\n6) The Board of Directors, at its meeting held on July 25, 2023, approved (subject to, inter alia, obtaining the regulatory and other approvals including from the Hon’ble National\\nCompany Law Tribunal (NCLT)) a Scheme of Arrangement (Scheme) for reduction, through cancellation of the entire “A” Ordinary Share capital and in consideration thereof, issue\\nand allotment of New Ordinary Shares in the Company, in the manner as contemplated in the Scheme.\\nThe Hon’ble NCLT vide Order dated August 2, 2024 has sanctioned the Scheme which was effective from September 1, 2024. Accordingly, the Company cancelled 50,85,02,896 ‘A’\\nOrdinary shares of ₹2.00 each (₹102 crores) and issued 35,59,52,028 New Ordinary Shares of ₹2.00 each (₹71 crores). The resultant difference of ₹31 crores is recorded in Securities\\nPremium Account. Out of above 87,73,540 New Ordinary Shares are yet to be transferred to the ultimate shareholders/ beneficial owners through TML Securities Trust, constituted\\nfor implementation of the Scheme and the same is consolidated in the Financial Results. The total expenses of ₹68 crores (including ₹50 crores for the six months ended September\\n30, 2024) incurred on the cancellation of ‘A’ Ordinary Shares have been accounted through retained earnings. The issue of New Ordinary Shares as consideration for reduction by\\nway of cancellation of ‘A’ Ordinary Shares, was considered to be ‘Deemed Dividend’ in the hands of ‘A’ Ordinary Shareholders in terms of the Income Tax Act, 1961. The TDS liability\\nof the Company on the aforesaid ‘Deemed Dividend’, amounting to ₹1,073 crores, has been funded through sale of requisite number of New Ordinary Shares, in the manner as\\ncontemplated in the Scheme.\\n7) The Board of Directors has, at its meeting held on August 1, 2024, approved (subject to the requisite and other approvals) a Composite Scheme of Arrangement involving the\\ndemerger of its Commercial Vehicle (“CV”) business undertaking into TML Commercial Vehicles Limited (newly incorporated entity) and the merger of Tata Motors Passenger\\nVehicles Limited (“TMPVL”) with the existing listed company thereby resulting in two separate listed companies for the CV and Passenger Vehicle (“PV”) businesses. The Company\\nhas filed this Scheme of Arrangement on August 13, 2024 with respective stock exchanges where the shares of the Company are traded and the requisite approvals are awaited.\\n8) The Statutory Auditors have carried an audit of the above results for the quarter and six months ended September 30, 2024 and have issued an unmodified opinion on the same.\\n Tata Motors Limited\\n Girish Wagh\\nMumbai, November 8, 2024 Executive Director\"\n",
